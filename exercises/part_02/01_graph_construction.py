            Review both incorrect existing relationships and important missing
            relationships. Do not assume that equal Markdown heading levels mean
            that chunks are unrelated. Website extraction often flattens pages that
            are semantically hierarchical.
            Work systematically: first inspect every node that acts as an overview,
            hub, index, category, list, menu, or collection. Then identify detail
            nodes that elaborate the items, entities, services, locations, people,
            products, or topics introduced by that hub. Add a directed SUBSECTION
            relationship from the hub chunk to each matching detail chunk, even when
            both chunks have the same heading level or appear far apart. Use SECTION
            for broader landing-page-to-major-section links. Use NEXT_PART only for
            consecutive chunks belonging to the exact same section.
            Treat explicit hyperlinks, navigation labels, repeated entity names,
            overview-to-detail wording, and clear category membership as evidence.
            Do not add links based only on weak topical similarity. Review all nodes
            before returning, so every clear hub-to-detail flow is represented.
            Never create, remove, rename, or modify nodes. Every source and target
            must be an existing node ID. Make only corrections supported by concrete
            evidence and assign an honest confidence score.
            Use SECTION for section-level structural links, SUBSECTION for
            subsection-level structural links, and NEXT_PART for consecutive
            parts of the same section. Do not create any other relationship type.
            Return a result matching the required output schema. Inspect every
            overview-to-detail relationship before deciding that no correction is
            needed. Return an empty corrections list only when the existing
            relationships are already correct and complete."""
